    <h2><span class="highlight">Description</span></h2>
    <p>Chole Bhature is a popular North Indian dish consisting of spicy chickpeas (chole) and deep-fried bread
        (bhature). Begin by cooking chickpeas with onion-tomato masala and spices until rich and flavorful. For the
        bhature, prepare a soft dough using all-purpose flour, yogurt, and a leavening agent, then let it rest. Roll out
        and deep fry the dough into puffed golden bhature. Serve hot with onion salad, pickle, and lemon wedges for a
        delicious traditional meal.

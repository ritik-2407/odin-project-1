    <h2><span class="highlight">Description</span></h2>
    <p>To make a classic pizza, start by preparing a soft dough using flour, yeast, water, salt, and olive oil, then let
        it rise. Roll it out into a thin base, spread tomato sauce evenly, and top with mozzarella cheese and your
        favorite toppings like vegetables, pepperoni, or olives. Bake it in a preheated oven at around 220°C (430°F) for
        10–15 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. Finish with a sprinkle of herbs like oregano
        or basil before serving hot.
